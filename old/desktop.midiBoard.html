        <p class="projectText">This project of mine that I took on was my first real attempt at incorporating my love of microcontrollers
            and my fascination with music. My fascination started out by my roommate teaching me how to play the piano. I was having a
            hard time understanding how the single notes came together to form chords, while struggling to learn the most basic concepts
            of playing music, I decided the best way for me to learn how was to create my own project based around creating a
            instrument from scratch and thus the MIDI sound board was created!

        <p class="projectText">The components I used for this project are quite simple, I used the following to complete 
            the project:
        </p>
        <ul class="projectText" style="text-indent: 0%; padding-left: 10vw; padding-top: 3vh;">

                    Ardunio UNO</a></li>
            <li>48 Copper pipe plugs</li>
            <li>LOTS of wire</li>
            <li>USB to printer cable</li>
            <li>3D printed case</li>
            <li>Super glue</li>
            <li>Prototyping board</li>

          </ul>
        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>        
        
        <p class="projectText">This project is very tedious, if you are wanting to take this project on be warned, 
            its a lot of soldering and waiting for glue to dry, plus you will need a 3D printer. I would recommend 
            taking this project on as it was very satisfying when I completed it and got it working correctly.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>
        
        <p class="projectText">To start things out you will first need all the components listed on the top of the 
            page, after you have all the components I would recommend printing out the case to hold the copper plugs in place.
            While you are waiting for the print to finish, strip about 50 strands of wire the length of your forearm. 
        </p>
        
        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>
        <p class="projectText">When you have completed both of the previous steps you can put all 48 copper plugs into the holes
            in the case you have printed, take one of the stripped wires and wrap one end of it around the part of the copper plug
            that is sticking out of the bottom the case and use super glue to glue it onto the copper plug. Normally I would 
            say to solder it on, but copper and solder don’t like to stick to each other. I found it easiest to glue 1 row and 
            wait an hour or two for the glue to dry a little bit then move on to the next row. This process will be long and 
            tedious but there's more to come!

        <p class="projectText">After you have gotten all wires glued into place, you will want to route them all down into
            one of the corners. When you get them all in one corner you can then move on to soldering the electronics. Before
            you Solder the capacitive touch boards on to the Prototyping board you MUST set each sensor to have the correct
            I2C address, I accomplished this by scraping the traces on the ADD pads and soldering the 1 of the other pads
            together on the back of the board. Don't ask me why they have the boards designed this way, but this is the 
            only way I found that would change the I2C address. After this is done you are ready to put it all on the 
            prototyping boards!
        </p>
        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>
      
        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>
        <p class="projectText">Solder pins onto the prototyping board and solder all the same pins to each other minus the
            ADD pin ( ground to ground, 3.3V to 3.3V, etc.). Next connect the pins in the following order:
        </p>
        <ul class="projectText" style="text-indent: 0%; padding-left: 10vw; padding-top: 3vh;">
            <li>Ground to a spare wire</li>
            <li>3.3V to a spare wire</li>
            <li>SDA to a spare wire</li>
            <li>SCL to a spare wire</li>
            <li>ADD to corresponding jumped connection on back of board</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>

        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>
        <p class="projectText">After that has been completed you can move on to the most tedious part of the project. You 
            need to solder all 48 loose wires on the 3D printed case on to each input pin of the capacitive touch sensors. 
            Make sure to solder them in the correct order or else you will have to manually change the code I wrote for the 
            project.When you finally complete all the soldering you are almost finished! The project should look like this 
            at this step:

        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>

        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>
        <p class="projectText">The only steps left are to plug the spare wires coming off the prototyping board into the  
            correct pin on the Arduino, they are labeled on the Arduino so it should be straight forward. When  that is finished
            plug the USB cable into your computer and Arduino and upload the code found on my Github to the Ardunio. The 
            second to last step is to download this software called “The Hairless MIDI to Serial bridge” the reason you 
            need this is because the Ardunio UNO communicates with the Serial protocol and is missing the needed hardware 
            to send MIDI notes over USB so we use the software to do it for us. 
        </p>
        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>

        <div class="paragraphSpacer"></div>
        <p class="projectText">The final step is to install Ableton or other music software and configure it to use the 
            output from the Hairless software. This is what the final project should look like! At this point you are
            finished and ready to start making music.
