        <h2>Capcitive Touch MIDI Board</h2>
        <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
        <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This Project challanged my music abilty and programming ability. I used 48 capacitive sensors to detect when something that is condictive touches the sensor, the Ardunio reads the value and sends a MIDI note over USB into the computer for primary use in Ableton.</p>

        <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
        <h1 style="font-size: 5vh;">This Project orginaly started out as a Mario clone, but turned into something very far from mario. This project taght me valluable insite on how to work with more than just my self, I did all the programing and most of the art work behind the game. My friends made all the voice lines and background music.</h1>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This Project was my very first major Project I took on. As the title says, its a application you run on the command line and it will display the predefined calendars linked with your google account. In version 1 the code I wrote is very sloppy and not thought out very well. However in version 2 I took the time to plan out what I need and will  be doing alowing me to format my code to be a lot more reuasable.</p>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This Project was a blast to create. The AI club and I Development out own AI to detect if a person was wearing a mask in a given image. We went through all the steps in making an AI, we collected all of our own taining data and labeled it, we then trained the AI on the limited data (4 people can't collect a lot of data! plus it saves time on training) we were able to collect to make the AI </p>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This Project was the first Project that I made with out following a guide of sorts. I used 7 servos to create a mechanical seven segment display, I then hooked up a total of 4 of the displays together paired with a Ardunio adn RTC modual to keep acurate time.</p>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This was a project I decided to take on during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Step one of this project will take a .wav file and convert it into text. Step two takes the output file from step one and tokenizes the words so we can compute the frequency of words being said. This may or may not have been an attpemt to not have to take notes durning a Zoom class meeting.</p>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">These are a more advanced version of my custom light effects. This project I used a Raspbery pi as a spotify client to play music from speakers, at the same time the audio signal was being split and analyzed to find the highest peak value. It then would send that data to all devices listening and turn on the amout of LED's.</p>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This Project started my interest in music. I used two muscle sensors placed on any muscle on the body, the sensors would read a value anywhere from 0-1024 and based on the value it read, it would play a tone based on the value being read. a value of 0 would play a 20Hz tone and a 1024 value would play a 20,000Hz tone</p>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This was a simple program I made to try and get my college paid for by the nice people in this world. The bot has a few modes, the first one will request a random Venmo user $1 with the message "college fund plz :)" this unforantly did not work at all, never got a single dollar. The second mode, my personal favorate mode, is a spam bot, it will request incametal amounts of money from one user that you can define. </p>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This project is also another "Party Tirck". If you don't know what a PowerHour I will explain, you will have some music on and every 60 seconds the song will change, at that point you have to take a drink of the beverage that is in your hand, this process will go on for an hour. I hand picked the best 60 seconds of each song to play along with the music video for the song, the songs are randomly picked each time from a pool of 60+ songs. </p>

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">I have built many diffrent implimentaions of Lighting effects using RGB LED strips. I build a few custom shpaes that conform to be a Eulerian circuit. The LEDS were driven by my custom software driven by a ESP32866, the ESP is wifi enabled so most of the effects I am able to control with my phone. </p>

          <p style="font-size: 5vh;">This was a quick project that I put together in a few hours for a "party trick". I used a Alcohol Gas Sensor to find the blood alcohol content of people.</p>
