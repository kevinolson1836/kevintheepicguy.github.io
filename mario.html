            This was a spur of the molment project my friends and I made. It was
            a late night in the middle of the week, all four of us were sitting
            and relaxing in the living room when the topic of Mario came up and 
            how it would be fun to make our own game. We started joking around
            with some really dumb ideas on what we would make the game do.... 
            a few hours later I started the Project.

            To start off I need to give credit where credit is due. My friends help
            me come up with the orginal idea. Ryan helped with Music and some art, Brad
            helped with art and a voice line and Will helped with some art and voice lines.
            I did all of the coding and artwork. I could not have done this with out the music 
            and the smaller art work that my friends made.

            When we started, the orgial idea was to make an exact clone of Mario
            but as soon as I started coding I found it to be alot more fun and 
            enjoyable to start deviating from the orginal idea and turn it into 
            my own creation. after experamenting and getting a understanding of 
            Pygame I started the coding process. For this I knew i wanted to 
            structure it in many files for easy readability and not one massive
            file. This was my first time really diving deep into Classes and 
            importing other files I have made. I found this to be quite benifial
            when trying to understand what extactly my code was doing.

            I made a few seprate Classes. I have a class for managing the movment, 
            enemys and platforms.Putting the movement into a seprate Class that I 
            can import made adding new enemys or other 'pages/screens' from the main 
            game loop was very benifial when adding the movement. the Intro screen I
            spent alot of my time on trying to polish it off to make it look really
            nice to look at and understandhow the game works, the game over screen
            is still a work in progress. The retry works good enough for nowbut I 
            would like to revist it to fix some small bugs. The Leaderboard page 
            does not work how I want it tothis is defently going to need to be looked
            at again, it has a lot of bugs in it so this is on the TODO list.

            The main game loop works pretty well, there are a few small bugs with the 
            players position not completly on the platform they will be hovering a few
            pixles above the platform but thats not a big issue. some of the art work 
            needs to be 'fixed' and the animation needs to be added to them, this is 
            also on the TODO list.

            Over all I really enjoyed this Project, I can honestly say that I spent the
            most amount of time on this project than any of my other Projects. I also enjoyed
            this one quite alot, I found making a game allows me to be super creative, there is
            no rules that you have to follow or anything along the sorts. I had many ideas that
            I added into the game and then took out in the finial version, I added them just for
            fun and see if it would work.
